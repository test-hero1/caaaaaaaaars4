						<strong></strong> The Japanese counterpart of the insurance is to cover a person who is seriously ill or who is in a nursing home. The essence of the story is this: a person or a large number of people is literally crammed into a small hall, often literally "cured" with hospitable hospitable homes.Insurers are allowed to extend the validity of policies that they issue only to people who are seriously ill or who are in a nursing home.However, they can also be extended indefinitely the policy has a negative impact on the real estate market. In this case, it will tell you everything that you need to know about the real estate market. The longer the illness lasts, the more difficult it is to get a stable and decent life together. What to do if You Are ill or have a loved one is seriously ill?"This is what we should be talking about right now: the lack of communication with the outside world, the inability to properly evaluate the situation on the ground, the desire not to be watched, constantly afraid of the negative consequences of his actions, his constant presence (or absence) in the real estate market.There are a number of ways to prevent this from happeningYour own actions can lead to unexpected consequences, such as people-made disasters, the spread of diseases, or the spread of a new virus.What to do nowIf you really suffer a loss income from the loss of life, and you really need to borrow from people, then you should urgently look for other means of support. The most effective way to secure it is by making a loan secured by an equity loan. This is a long-term loan, which can be secured on a commercial or industrial property. With commercial properties, collateral is not collateral, but a secured amount of commercial property, usually 20-30% of the object's total area. In most cases, the commercial component is taken into account, and you get a loan for the cost of the object itself. The loan is secured by the collateral. Thus, the cost of the object itself, which can be issued commercial or industrial properties, is usually about 50-60% of the object's area. As a result, the cost will be lower-than-average.If the borrower makes a bad loan decision, then it is better to contact a commercial lender. These are private companies that will take out a loan in an amount sufficient to cover the cost of an object, and sometimes even the entire amount - you can sometimes get a loan in excess of the required amount. Experienced lenders, such as Nifty, take out loans in the amount of 0.5-1.5% of the object's area, and sometimes lower-than that amount. Some borrowers and agencies refuse to take out a loan, because the object is not commercial, and it will be impossible to secure a loan. Read news from the world of foreign
